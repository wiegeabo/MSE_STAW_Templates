This is a brief introduction to the Magic Set Editor 2 template for Star Trek Attack Wing created by Strormer.

The current version of the template is a beta version and some features are not fully implemented. A changelog will be added to this readme for future releases.

Also, this initial version was created using the .psd files of a custom card template I found a long time ago on Board Game Geek. Unfortunately, I've completely fogotten who posted it originally. If anyone knows who created this initial version, please let me know so I can credit them in this readme.

******FAQ******************************************
What is this template?
This is a template to create custom Star Trek Attack Wing cards using the Magic Set Editor program. It is intended to make custom card creation by the community easier.

How do I use it?
1. In order to use this template you must first download Magic Set Editor (MSE). This is a long-standing program used to    create custom Magic the Gathering cards (as well as cards for other TCG's).
   It can be found here: http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/download.html
2. Once you have installed MSE to your computer you'll want to unzip my template to your MSE "data" folder.
3. Install the two fonts included in the package. (These don't need to stay in your data folder afterwards.)

Why are you releasing this now if it's not finished?
I have been working on this off and on for a little over a year now and I've got it in a state that I feel is at least somewhat useful. I've also recently had a little girl and expect I won't be putting nearly as much time into developing this template. For this reason I wanted to give what I had to the community so my work up to this point wasn't wasted. I do plan to complete the template (and implement feedback from the group), but I don't have a realistic timeline for doing so right now.

The new card packs have new elements on the cards. Will these be in the template?
New style elements (introduced with the new card packs) are not yet available for this template, though I hope to add them in the future. If anyone wants to get me some .psd files of these new elements (such as the limited uniqueness type or the new arc symbols) that would be very helpful.

******Version Details******************************

There are currently 4 functional card types which require beta testing and feedback. These are Ship Cards, Upgrade Cards, Maneuver Cards, and Resource Cards.

Oversize Resource cards are in development, but are not even close to functional yet. I left them visible just as a teaser of future features (and becuase I didn't feel like going into the code to hide them).

You can enter certain symbols by typing in commands. A full list of these commands is below:
  ACTIONS
    e) = Evade Action
    t) = Target Lock Action
    s) = Scan Action
    b) = Battle Stations Action
    l) = Cloak Action
    o) = Sensor Echo Action
    r) = Regenerate Action
    w) = Power Transfer Action (fan-addition, not official per WK)
  UPGRADE SLOTS
    b] = Borg Slot
    c] = Crew Slot
    e] = Elite Talent Slot
    ?] = ? Slot
    s] = Squadron Slot
    t] = Tech Slot
    w] = Weapon Slot
  SLOTS FOR EFFECTS
    b} = Borg Slot
    c} = Crew Slot
    e} = Elite Talent Slot
    ?} = ? Slot
    s} = Squadron Slot
    t} = Tech Slot
    w} = Weapon Slot
  MANEUVERS FOR EFFECTS
    w- = Straight Maneuver
    a- = Bank Left Maneuver
    s- = Reverse Manveuver
    d- = Bank Right Maneuver
    q- = Turn Left Maneuver
    e- = Turn Right Manevuer
    z- = Spin Left Maneuver
    x- = Spin Right Maneuver
    r- = Come About Maneuver
    t- = Full About Maneuver
  EFFECTS
    h} = Normal Damage
    i} = Critical Damage

If you're going to make a set that includes a ship with multiple upgrades, I recommend selecting upgrade as your default card type when creating the new set. You can then individually change a card's style from the "style" tab to be a ship or maneuver card or the like. This isn't required, just easier.

The maneuver cards have several drop downs on them which causes a slight lag when first opening that style up. I still haven't figured out a workaround for this issue.

A quick explination of the ERAs
    Any - (Default) This card can be allowed in any era of Trek as it's not tied to one show or another.
    ENT - This is from Enterprise or some other pre-The Cage Trek (if you're so inclined).
    TOS - This is from the original Star Trek series. This includes everything from The Cage up to (but not including) The Motion Picture.
    TMP - This is from the original-cast Star Trek movies and extends out through Picard on the Stargazer. (Basically everything with the magificent maroon uniform.)
    TNG - This is from The Next Generation series and includes everything through the film Generations.
    DSV - This is from Deep Space Nine, Voyager, or one of the movies from First Contact through Nemesis.
    FUT - This is something from beyond the Nemesis time period. This could include things as recent as Star Trek Titan all the way through the 29th century future Federation and their temporal prime directive.
